## For demo purposes only - not for production

Some Cloudformation templates I'm playing with.
Creating discrete templates but will pull together in nest when a complete set.

This piece will setup small Docker Swarm on EC2 for test, training & demo. Aiming to be actuated with one button press and no pre-created elements. Plan to create ECS / EKS / Fargate versions at later stage for comparison. Will contain some production attributes but should be considered PoC quality - no rigour applied!
